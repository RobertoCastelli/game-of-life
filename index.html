        <p>
            The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician
            John Horton
            Conway in 1970.
            The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no
            further
            input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
            evolves, or, for
            advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.
